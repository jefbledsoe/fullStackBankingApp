            Bottomless Vault Banking reserves the right to suspend, terminate,
            or close your account if you violate these Terms of Service or
            engage in any prohibited activities. This section outlines the
            procedures and implications regarding account termination:
            Termination by You: You may choose to terminate your account at any
            time by contacting our customer support team and requesting the
            closure of your account. Upon account closure, you may no longer
            have access to certain features or services provided by Bottomless
            Vault Banking. Termination by Bottomless Vault Banking: We may
            suspend, terminate, or close your account if we believe that you
            have violated these Terms, engaged in fraudulent activities, or
            posed a risk to the security or integrity of our services. We will
            make reasonable efforts to provide notice prior to termination,
            except in cases where immediate termination is necessary for legal,
            security, or operational reasons. Effect of Account Closure: Upon
            termination or closure of your account, you will no longer have
            access to your account information, transaction history, or any
            other data associated with your account. Any remaining balances or
            funds in your account may be subject to applicable laws and
            regulations regarding account closure and funds disposal. Survival
            of Obligations: The termination or closure of your account does not
            relieve you of any obligations or liabilities that have accrued
            prior to such termination. You remain responsible for any
            outstanding fees, charges, or other obligations incurred through
            your use of our services. Bottomless Vault Banking reserves the
            right to take appropriate legal action, including seeking damages
            and injunctive relief, in response to any violations of these Terms
            or applicable laws. If you have any questions or concerns regarding
            account termination or closure, please contact our customer support
            team for assistance.
